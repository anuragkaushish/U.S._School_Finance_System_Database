# U.S._School_Finance_System_Database
Created a relational database for US School Finance Data.
This project focuses on creating ER(Logical) Model.
Used the model to create tables and other consttraints in MYSQL, and then populate the database with the data from the dataset( 2010-2015).
From ER Model create a Dimensional Model , use Dimensional Model to ( in a new database) create tables and constraints, and then populate this new database with data from the prior database that was created.
